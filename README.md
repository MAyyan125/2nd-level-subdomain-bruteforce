# Subbruter

I wrote this code to address a crucial issue I encountered with Subfinder, which I've missed many times. I needed to pass a file to Subfinder in order to brute-force subdomains from it. Essentially, Subfinder lacked the option to specify a list of subdomains from a .txt file. This tool utilizes Subfinder to discover subdomains from the specified .txt file.
